# IRL Transparent objects set

## About
* This dataset was collected for my AI Master's thesis work titled **Enhancing depth estimation for transparent objects** carried out at [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/masters/artificial-intelligence/?lang=en) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Hamidreza](https://hkasaei.github.io/#research) and [Prof. Dr. Matias](https://mvaldenegro.github.io/)

## Code
* The code to collect and convert data into required formats is available in [scripts/](scripts/)
* The main code used for the AI master's thesis work is available in another repository named [clearGraspPlus](https://github.com/AbhishekRS4/clearGraspPlus)

## Data
* The dataset is available in [data/](data/)

## Sample Images
* The following are some sample images from the dataset for single and multi object scenarios
